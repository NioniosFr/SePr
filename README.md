#### Description  
For this project we are going to implement a dummy "Internal Wiki" for a company.  The purpose of this is to practice and present secure development methods and implementations.

#### Functionality Requirements

##### Login Screen
A secure login screen will handle user authentication  

##### Chat functionality  
A secure chat will be implemented to enable users to comunicate with one another  

##### Wiki page  
A simple page containing sensitive company information  

##### Multiple user permissions  
There will be two types of users that will be able to access the application.  The difference will be that one user can only read information from the page and the other will be able to edit it.
